# DNA-translator

This project is a dna to protein translator. By entering a strand of dna, you first get its reversed and complemented version, then its transcription into an amino acid chain.

This program can read files in fasta format, a text file format used to store biological sequences of a nucleic or protein nature.

This program offers you several possibilities: 
- You can visualize a counter giving the number of nucleobases A, T, G and C. 
- You can generate a random DNA strand of the length you want
- You can read a fasta file
- You can use the reverse and complement features on the DNA strand
- You can visualize the amino acid chain with a phase of 0, 1 or 2. 
- You can visualize the amino acid chain with the conventional codes of 1 or 3 letters.

# Setup and run

There are no special libraries to install, the program uses Tkinter, a basic module integrated in Python.
To run the program, run the file **`DnaTranslator.py`** (in the src folder) from a terminal.
