# DNA-translator

This project is a dna to protein translator. By entering a strand of dna, you first get its reversed and complemented version, then its transcription into an amino acid chain.

This program can read files in fasta format, a text file format used to store biological sequences of a nucleic or protein nature.

# Setup and run

There are no special libraries to install, the program uses Tkinter, a basic module integrated in Python.
To run the program, run the file **`DnaTranslator.py`** from a terminal.
